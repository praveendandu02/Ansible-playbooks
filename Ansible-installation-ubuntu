$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible

- add hosts into default hosts file by cd into sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts.
  note: we are doing sudo here as this file is owned by route
- SSH configuration
  -create user ansible 
   sudo useradd ansible
   sudo passwd ansible
  - Login into ansible user
    su - ansible
  - now run ansible ping to localhost
    ansible localhost -m ping
    now enter the pasword
    if you get error then ssh into localhost
    ssh localhost
    exit now
    and run the ansible ping command
    
- configure slave node (centos)
  - ssh into slave node user@slvaenode
  - sudo into root sudo -i
  - create ansible user
  
- configure slave node (ubuntu)
  - ssh into slave node user@slavenode
  - sudo into root sudo su -
  - create ansible user
    adduser ansible
    
- go back to control node and login into ansible user and create a ssh preshared key for authentication
  - generate ssh key: ssh-keygen 
  - enter all defaults
  - now copy ssh key into slave nodes
  - ssh-copy-id node1
  - enter the password
  - do the same for remaining nodes
  - we need to do the same for localhost as well 
  - ssh localhost
  
- it is also possible to prompt for a sudo password at runtime using -K (note uppercase) if desired (note this can become a challenge when executing against many systems)

- For the most automated configuration, edit `etc/sudoers` to allow the ansible user to use sudo with any command without password by using the line:
  ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
